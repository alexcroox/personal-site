## CLI tool to bootstrap new projects at Hectare

In early May we began to overhaul of all the services/apis at Hectare using Serverless and Lambda. In order to maintain consistancy across all our microservices, I created a cli tool to allow our developers to run a single command and have a boilerplate created with all our agreed practices already configured.

An older version of the project generator, before it became part of a private npm module, [can be found here](https://github.com/alexcroox/hectare-project-generator).
