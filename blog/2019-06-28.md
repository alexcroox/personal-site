## Serverless Prerender

The old company site was a SPA without SSR and needed older social crawlers to be able to pick up on SEO meta tags.

We were paying quite a large amount a month for an external company to render the html for us when we redirected bot traffic to it.

I created a serverless Lambda API using Puppeteer to load a requested URL, return the HTML and cache to S3 for 1 day.
