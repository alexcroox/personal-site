## Serverless Prerender

The old company site was a SPA without SSR and needed older social crawlers to be able to pick up on SEO meta tags.

We were paying quite a large amount a month for an external company to render the html for us when we redirected bot traffic to it.

I created a serverless Lambda API using Puppeteer to load a requested URL, return the HTML and cache to S3 for 24 hours. We now have a self hosted, fully scalable in-house solution to prerendering. Of course all new projects will use SSR so the goal is to de-commission this service, but it's great to regain a chunk of the dev budget for only a mornings work.
