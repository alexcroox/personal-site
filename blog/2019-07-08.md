## Beautiful & Painless PDF Generation

Many times in my dev career I've had to create a PDF invoice or receipt. I started with libraries like PDFKit that make you position every element painfully with pixel coordinates. Then I moved onto html-pdf libraries that allow you to create your PDF in html then launch a browser instance to render and convert to PDF. It had it's limitations and was quite fragile and resource heavy, but was the best solution at the time.

The other downside to these 2 techniques is they both rely on the developer to design and handcraft the PDF, which can be limited by time and implementation challanges.

### DOCX -> PDF

Recently I found a combination of several libraries, which would allow the marketing / finance teams to handle the design and layout of the document. This could be done with tools they are familiar with such as Google Docs or MS Word.

After they've created the `.docx` template, the developer simply goes in and replaces dynamic content with Mustache variables that the template parser will replace.

_Yes, the above template isn't "beautiful", it's just something I whipped up to demo to the team!_

Using the `docxtemplater` library we can pass in an object of template data and generate a new `.docx` file with the Mustache variables filled.

Finally we use a `docx-wasm` library to convert the filled in `.docx` file to a perfect `.pdf` copy.

### PDF Microservice

Off the back of this, I created a PDF microservice where other services could POST a template payload and the S3 path of the template to use.

```
{
	"templateBucketFilePath": "invoice-templates/hectare-invoice.docx",
	"templateData": {
		"invoiceId": "#12345",
        "companyName": "Example Co",
        "invoiceDate": "1st July 2019",
        ...
    }
}
```

After generation I simply pass back the base64 encoded file data for the requester to use elsewhere.

**The result of all of this is that a developer only has to provide a .docx template path and a data object in order to produce a beautiful PDF with no compromises.**
