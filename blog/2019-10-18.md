## Automated Lighthouse Mobile Performance Testing

Over 70% of our user base are using mobile, and most live in remote countryside farms with terrible internet. When I was tasked with the re-build of the company's main trading platform, performance was one of my main areas of focus.

It's easy to start out with good intentions, and even easier to to lose focus when you have an entire platform to build and deadlines looming. If I'm honest, in the past I might test performance scores after initial scaffolding, just before shipping, and occasionally in-between.

**I wanted a constant reminder of my goal, and an easy way to spot if that latest dev commit had degraded performance for any reason.**

## Lighthouse and Docker

The result:

Using Google's Lighthouse node module and a Docker container I was able to headlessly launch the site, report performance using a throttled CPU and network mobile device, upload the html report to S3 and post to Slack.

```
const lighthouse = require('lighthouse')
const chromeLauncher = require('chrome-launcher')
const axios = require('axios')
const AWS = require('aws-sdk')
const s3 = new AWS.S3({
  region: 'eu-west-2'
})

function launchChromeAndRunLighthouse(url, flags = {}, config = null) {
  return chromeLauncher.launch(flags).then(chrome => {
    flags.port = chrome.port
    return lighthouse(url, flags, config).then(results => chrome.kill().then(() => results))
  })
}

const flags = {
  chromeFlags: ['--headless', '--disable-gpu', '--no-sandbox'],
  output: 'html'
}

launchChromeAndRunLighthouse('https://xxxx.xxxx.xxx', flags)
  .then(async results => {
    let scores = results.lhr.categories
    const fileKey = `lighthouse-results/cli-report.${Date.now()}.html`

    try {
      // Upload the html report to S3
      await s3
        .putObject({
          Bucket: 'xxxx',
          Key: fileKey,
          Body: results.report,
          ContentType: 'text/html'
        })
        .promise()
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('Error uploading report to S3', error)
    }

    try {
      // Post the results and report link to Slack
      await axios({
        method: 'POST',
        url: 'https://xxxx.xxxx.xxxx/notify/v1/slack',
        data: {
          message: `
        Performance Results for https://xxxx.xxxx.xxx\n${scores.performance.score *
          100}% Performance\n${scores.accessibility.score * 100}% Accessibility\n${scores['best-practices'].score *
            100}% Best Practices\n${scores.seo.score *
            100}% SEO\nFull report: https://xxxx.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/${fileKey}
      `,
          channels: ['deployments']
        }
      })
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('Failed to send to Slack', error)
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log('Error running lighthouse', error)
  })
```

The above script is run in our CI/CD pipeline and uses the following Docker/Environment config (Debian):

```
apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
apt-transport-https \
ca-certificates \
curl \
gnupg \
--no-install-recommends \
&& curl -sSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | bash - \
&& curl -sSL https://dl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | apt-key add - \
&& echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list \
&& apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
google-chrome-stable \
nodejs \
--no-install-recommends

npm i -g lighthouse
```

Our automated deployment pipeline now looks like this, keeping me in the loop if new features are detracting from my original goal.
