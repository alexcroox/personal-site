## Cloudflare Custom Domain S3 Caching

Our current codebase is serving all user generated content from S3 directly using the S3 `s3.amazonaws.com` address. Through this we serve Terabytes of data from S3 on a monthly basis, which gets expensive real fast.

In the past I have always paired S3 with Cloudfront for caching of these assets, however at Hectare we use Cloudflare as our CDN for everything. Since Cloudflare only charges a flat rate and comes packed with useful features, caching TBs of data transfer through Cloudflare would seem preferable.

I found that without the tight coupling of AWS services, it wasn't trivial to create a custom domain that proxied all of our S3 requests to existing buckets without a fair amount of wrangling. I've recently started building Cloudflare edge JS workers for a number of tasks, and I saw another opportunity to utilise it's powerful ability to modify requests and responses.

The goal was to replace all S3 URLs with our own custom domain, that cached every request.

From: `https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-asset-bucket-production/object-key.png`

To: `https://assets.custom-domain.com/my-asset-bucket-production/object-key.png`

So with 1,000 users requesting an image, we would only be charged for the 1st user requesting the image.

### Cloudflare worker

```
// Whitelist of buckets to stop other people using our cache for their own buckets!
const allowedBuckets = [
  'my-asset-bucket-production',
  'my-asset-bucket-dev'
]

addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(fetchAndApply(event.request))
})

async function fetchAndApply(request) {
  const requestUrl = new URL(request.url)

  let pathSplit = requestUrl.pathname.split('/')
  let [ emptySlash, bucketName, bucketKey ] = pathSplit

  if (!allowedBuckets.includes(bucketName)) {
    return new Response("Bucket name not allowed, configure Cloudflare Worker to whitelist this bucket")
  }

  // Construct the S3 object URL based on our request URL
  const s3Url = new URL(`https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com${requestUrl.pathname}${requestUrl.search}`)
  const s3Request = new Request(s3Url, new Request(request))

  let cache = caches.default

  // Cloudflare's automatic cache works off the original request URL, since we are modifying it we need
  // to control the cache ourselves. First find a matching request for the S3 url.
  let cachedResponse = await cache.match(s3Request)

  // If we don't have a cache hit for that object, let's fetch it fresh from the S3 origin, cache it and return
  if (!cachedResponse) {
    let originResponse = await fetch(s3Request)
    cache.put(s3Request, originResponse.clone())
    return originResponse
  } else {
    return cachedResponse
  }
}
```

The DNS for `assets.custom-domain.com` can point to wherever you want because the Worker will intercept the request before it can reach it's destination.
