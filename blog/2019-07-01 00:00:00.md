## Private NPM modules

I've been building on the company project generator to move a lot of the boilerplate into npm modules. 

This removes a lot of code duplication between our API services and allows for easy updating in the future.

So far we have for our API services:

`@hectare/service-log`

Adds generic logging capabilities to your service.

Includes optional Mongo and Sentry logging.



`@hectare/service-express`

Injects all our typical middleware and express setup



`@hectare/service-mongoose`

Connects to the mongo db you've defined in env.yml and returns the usual mongoose object.

I'll be adding ones for our Front End Vue.js templates soon too.
